# Employ - A Social Networking App for IOS 

I built my own social networking platform from scratch for a job employment application on IOS which included features such as: a friend request system, an intelligent search engine, a unique job management system, a user location tracking system with the integration of a Google API, a Distance Matrix API was integrated to calculate distances and durations between users. A cloud hosted JSON tree was used to store, retrieve and manage data. This project was accomplished using: a large number of self-taught skills, development of my own algorithms and extensive research.
