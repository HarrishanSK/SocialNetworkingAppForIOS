# Employ - A Social Networking App for IOS 

I built my own social networking platform from scratch for a job employment application on IOS which included features such as: a friend request system, an intelligent search engine, a unique job management system, a user location tracking system with the integration of a Google API, a Distance Matrix API was integrated to calculate distances and durations between users. A cloud hosted JSON tree was used to store, retrieve and manage data. This project was accomplished using: a large number of self-taught skills, development of my own algorithms and extensive research.

The app consists of 6 main pages: log in, profile, search, jobs, contacts and info.
Below are some screenshots which show what the first 4 pages look like.

When a user logs in through the log in page the entered credentials are sent to the server and confirmed based on thhe information stored in the cloud hosted JSON tree. If the log in is successful, the user's 'profile page' would be loaded along with the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. From this point onwards the user can navigate through the remaining 4 pages.

The above 2 pages show the contacts and info pages. The contact page stores a list of users who you have connected with using the app (similar to a friend list on facebook). The info page provides helpful information to navigate around the app.
